This is Java code that I wrote while tutoring a 16-year-old computer science student

It covers important fundamentals, including but certainly not limited to:
1. implicit and explicit casting
2. loops and recursion
3. data structures
4. iterators, list iterators, and enumerations
5. OOP principles
6. inheritance and polymorphism
7. threading
8. pass by value
