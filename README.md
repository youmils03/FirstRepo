This is an initial training repository to store my code.

I like writing code to:
1. help tutor/explain it to others
2. have fun and be creative
3. keep myself afloat in coding to retain myself per industry standards

In the Java section, I primarily have object-oriented code that I wrote, explaining it to a kid I have tutored.

In the Python section, I have snippits of code for each of 72 Youtube videos that I have, each of which exlains some section of the Python curriculum.

In the Linux section, I have some bash files that can be run using a Linux operating system. I accumulated this experience working over a year at a software engineering company, and I believe it is highly relevant.

Enjoy!
